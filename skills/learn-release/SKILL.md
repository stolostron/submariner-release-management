## The Big Picture

Submariner releases 9 container images through Konflux to Red Hat's registry. The process has 4 phases:

1. **Setup** (Y-stream only): Create release branch, configure Konflux pipelines
2. **Build**: Fix policy violations, scan for CVEs, cut upstream release, update bundle
3. **Stage**: Create release, add notes, publish to stage registry, QE tests
4. **Prod**: After QE approval, publish to production registry

**Y-stream** (0.21→0.22): New minor version. Run all steps starting from Step 1.
**Z-stream** (0.21.1→0.21.2): Patch release. Skip to Step 4 (branch already exists).

**Gates:** Setup (Y-stream) → Builds + EC → CVE triage → Release notes →
**Stage:** Stage release → FBC update + builds + EC → FBC stage releases → QE approval →
**Prod:** Prod release (same snapshot) → FBC prod releases

## Key Concepts

**Build:**

- **Component**: Konflux build unit. Each produces one container image. Submariner has 9 components across 5 repos.
- **Hermetic**: Isolated builds with pre-fetched dependencies (Go mods, RPMs). Required by EC for reproducibility.
- **SBOM**: Software Bill of Materials. Lists all dependencies. Required by EC for security/compliance.
- **Multi-arch**: Builds for x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le, s390x. Requires Customer Portal activation key for RPM access.

**Release artifacts:**

- **Snapshot**: Immutable component references (image SHAs). Event types: `push` (merge) or `pull_request`.
- **Bundle**: Container with operator metadata (CSV, CRDs). References 7 component images via `relatedImages`.
- **FBC**: File-Based Catalog. Operator index for OLM. See FBC section below.

**FBC (File-Based Catalog):**

- **Purpose**: Makes Submariner installable via OLM. Publishes to Red Hat's operator index (appears in OperatorHub).
- **Template**: `catalog-template.yaml` is source of truth. `make build-catalogs` generates 6 `catalog-4-XX/` directories.
- **Bundles**: Version entries (e.g., `submariner.v0.22.0`) containing bundle image SHA and `relatedImages` (7 components).
- **Channels**: Update paths (e.g., `stable-0.22`). Users subscribe to a channel and get upgrades within it.
- **Version pruning**: `drop-versions.json` maps OCP versions to minimum Submariner versions (e.g., OCP 4.20 drops anything before 0.20).
- **Image lifecycle**: Bundles use temporary `quay.io` URLs (~90 day TTL). Step 20 updates to `registry.redhat.io`.

**Konflux resources (K8s CRDs):**

- **Application**: Groups components. `submariner-0-X` has 9 components; 6 `submariner-fbc-4-XX` apps each have 1 catalog.
- **Snapshot**: Immutable component references (image SHAs). Created after builds complete. Query with `oc get snapshots`.
- **ReleasePlan**: Links application to RPA. Lives in tenant namespace (submariner-tenant). Referenced by Release CRs.
- **RPA**: ReleasePlanAdmission. Defines release pipeline, EC policy, registry config. Lives in managed namespace (rhtap-releng-tenant).
- **Release CR**: Triggers publishing. References snapshot + releasePlan. Contains releaseNotes for advisories.
- **EC Policy**: Enterprise Contract policy. Checks labels, hermetic builds, CVEs, signatures, provenance. Violations block releases.
- **activation-key Secret**: Enables RPM prefetch in hermetic builds. Contains Customer Portal org ID and activation key.

**Reference:**

- **Stage vs Prod**: Stage publishes to registry.stage.redhat.io; prod to registry.redhat.io.
- **Version formats**: `0.21` (branch), `0-21` (Konflux names), `v0.21.2` (Dockerfile labels), `0.21.2` (commits/PRs).
- **ACM mapping**: Submariner 0.X → ACM 2.(X-7). Example: 0.21 → 2.14, 0.22 → 2.15.
- **Advisory types**: RHSA (security/CVEs), RHBA (bug fixes), RHEA (enhancements). Type determines release notes format.

## Step Details

| Step | Details |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1 | Use releases repo tooling to create `release-0.X` branches across 9 upstream repos. |
| 2 | Add overlays (app, 9 components, ReleasePlans) and RPAs in konflux-release-data. ArgoCD syncs; triggers bot PRs. |
| 3 | Customize Tekton configs: hermetic builds (Go mods, RPM lockfiles), multi-arch, SBOM. Version labels. 8 components, 5 repos. |
| 3b | Two parts: (1) update bundle CSV with component SHAs from snapshot, (2) set up bundle Tekton pipeline. Components must build first. |
| 4 | Enterprise Contract validates Red Hat release policies. Fix violations in component repos (9 images) and FBC repo (6 catalogs). |
| 5 | Grype scans Go (7 repos), clair scans images. Fix→rebuild→rescan loop. Go stdlib CVEs fixed in Shipyard (base image for others). |
| 5b | Bump version labels in 9 Dockerfiles across 5 repos. Bundle has 3 labels (csv-version, release, version). Rebuild triggers. |
| 6 | Run releases repo tooling to create git tags and publish images to quay.io/submariner. Official upstream release. |
| 7 | Update bundle CSV `relatedImages` with SHAs from latest passing Konflux snapshot. Must use registry.redhat.io URLs for EC. |
| 8 | Create Release CR YAML: copy previous, update name/snapshot. Save to `releases/0.X/stage/`. Don't add notes yet. |
| 9 | Query Jira: CVEs automatic, user selects other issues. RHSA/RHBA/RHEA based on content. Exclude submariner-addon. |
| 10 | Run `make apply` to create Release CR on cluster. Pipeline publishes 9 images to registry.stage.redhat.io. |
| 10b | Check `Released` condition. If failed: check ManagedPipelineProcessed, get log URL, determine retry vs fix. Increment suffix. |
| 11 | Update FBC catalogs in submariner-operator-fbc repo with bundle SHA from stage registry. Wait ~15-30 min for rebuilds. |
| 12 | Find passing FBC snapshots (push events only). Verify bundle SHA matches across all 6 catalogs. Create 6 Release YAMLs. |
| 13 | Apply 6 FBC releases with `make apply`. Each publishes catalog to stage index for its OCP version. |
| 13b | Check all 6 Released conditions. Same debug process as 10b. All must succeed before QE handoff. |
| 14 | Extract catalog URLs from snapshots. Create Jira ticket for QE with 6 URLs. **Wait for QE approval before prod.** |
| 15 | Copy stage YAML to prod directory. Change name (stage→prod) and releasePlan (stage-0-X→prod-0-X). Same snapshot/notes. |
| 16 | Apply prod release. Pipeline publishes to registry.redhat.io (production). Same 9 images as stage. |
| 16b | Verify prod pipeline succeeded. Same debug process as 10b. |
| 17 | Copy 6 FBC stage YAMLs to prod directories. Change names and releasePlans. Same snapshots - catalog URLs work for both. |
| 18 | Apply 6 FBC prod releases. Publishes catalogs to production indices (registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index). |
| 18b | Verify all 6 succeeded. Release is now live in production OperatorHub. |
| 19 | Extract index URLs from release status. Notify QE. **Submariner 0.X.Y production release complete.** |
| 20 | Optional cleanup: update FBC templates to use registry.redhat.io URLs. Prevents breakage when quay.io images expire. |
