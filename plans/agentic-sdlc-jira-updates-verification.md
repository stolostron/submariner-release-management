# Jira planning verification

Evidence audit: October 6–7, 2026; includes the complete assignment population, issue documents, public work and retained tenant artifacts.
[current-work.md](current-work.md) owns current engineering observations, [jira-update-queue.md](jira-update-queue.md) owns issue dispositions,
and [agentic-sdlc-jira-updates.md](agentic-sdlc-jira-updates.md) owns epic execution. Planning commits are published through [WIP PR #111](https://github.com/stolostron/submariner-release-management/pull/111), as requested. Four approved existing-story comments were posted and verified October 7 at 18:23 UTC. No Jira field edit, transition, PR comment, cluster change or release was performed.
Private raw exports and pre-edit plan copies are retained outside this public checkout.

## Complete assigned-issue sweep

| Read | Result and limits |
| --- | --- |
| Paginated `assignee = currentUser() ORDER BY updated DESC`, no project/status/date restriction | 703 unique issues across ACM, CORENET, OPGM, KFLUXMIG, HYCLD, CLOUDWF, ODL, RCM and BREW |
| Active status-category query, also unrestricted | 80: 76 non-Vulnerability issues and four Vulnerability issues; its key set matches the active subset of the complete search |
| Terminal assigned history | 623: 144 non-Vulnerability and 479 Vulnerability issues; no reopening/bulk update proposed |
| Comprehensive initial full-view sweep | all 220 assigned issues plus nine related non-Vulnerability issues and four active private Vulnerability views; 233 full documents read |
| Non-Vulnerability `updated >= "2026-09-13"` query | 118 issues, 53 terminal; mutable update time does not prove recent implementation |
| Epic membership queries | ACM-39728 has ten direct children; CORENET-7155 has zero, and its description remains empty |
| Initial full comment pagination on 21 update/reconciliation targets | Returned unique ids reconcile with reported totals, including 159 comments on ACM-40644 rather than the 100 in its issue view |
| Latest public work discovery | 23 authored PRs updated since September 30, 16 currently open authored PRs, five authored issues updated since September 30; populations overlap |
| Initial direct PR sweep | 24 direct reads, including all 16 open authored PRs, releases#1444, EVPN #2–7 and cve-agent#35. Five merged PRs for ACM-34592 checked earlier |

The 76 non-Vulnerability active issues reconcile exactly to queue groups: automation 10, releases 17,
deadline/lifecycle/legacy eight, Kubernetes/MCN/EVPN 41. No private vulnerability keys or descriptions are copied into the queue.
Search counts and active categories were compared by unique key; absence in a filtered query was not treated as absence from Jira.
All assigned Vulnerability issues received inventory/status coverage; the deeper pass also fetched full views for the four active cases. No fresh shipped-image applicability/fix triage was performed.
Their four active cases remain private follow-up; the historical 259 closures below are a different population.

The comment CLI emits consecutive page objects and rendered text, which can omit rich-text links.
Pages were decoded, flattened and checked against each reported total; issue ADF was retained separately for exact links and field editing.
Neither rendered text nor an issue view's first 100 comments is a safe replacement document for Jira rich text.

Fresh observations add OPGM-364's existing lifecycle-publication scope and status request, ACM-25779's stale console template,
ACM-34593's original build-failure acceptance scope, and the already-created MCN CI subtask set.
The May draft saying it will split into subtasks is obsolete. ACM-34592's five linked PRs all merged May 28;
the latest pass now finds a successful October 2 route-agent push build for its sibling, with a separate failing EC scenario. Fix attribution and original acceptance criteria still need review. Both contribution children require an ai-helpers merge,
and ACM-39740 additionally requires another product's validation. CVE-agent#35's source merge is preparatory evidence only.

## Current checks and local work

The first proposed-action audit read 114 full non-Vulnerability documents, including 29 additional scope/duplicate candidates.
The latest read-only content pass before posting repeated the complete 703-issue inventory and read 88 active/payload targets: descriptions, comments,
status, PR fields, parent/subtasks and actual update fields are unchanged against the preceding full-view baseline. All four active private Vulnerability full views were also refreshed, without shipped-image triage.
Before posting, all comments on 27 targets were paginated again, including the OLMv1 correction target; both epic memberships and duplicate-query populations remain unchanged. The bounded historical closure query still returns 259.
Both projects' complete create metadata and 21 existing targets' edit/transition metadata were re-read successfully with the same field constraints.
The preceding 44 unique direct PR reads include the five legacy-closeout PRs, the OLMv1 reference and all six June Kubernetes qualification PRs. The June results remain one merged and five closed without merging; the K2 draft now links all six. Published heads/states are unchanged against the preceding pass apart from this planning PR. EVPN #6 verify passes at 629d9e67; tide remains pending and the import is still open. The focused first-chunk audit subsequently read all nine relevant PRs and their complete changed-file pages; Shipyard advanced during the successive focused audits; its dated posted comment retains the 3b67af1a snapshot.
The earlier next-chunk read pins Shipyard to a88023ad, with hosted checks still running, one unresolved current YAML thread and four unresolved outdated threads. No review or approval is on that head; aggregate changes requested comes from earlier heads. Historical inventories retain their explicit cutoff and are separate from today's work.

| Deeper check | Result affecting the plan |
| --- | --- |
| Latest GitHub review-thread pagination | Shipyard #2582: 39 threads, three unresolved/current and four unresolved/outdated; current-head changes requested and no approval on a88023ad. #2618: two threads, zero current/unresolved and an approval on current head despite older changes-requested aggregate |
| Exact local source inspection | Shipyard HEAD matches published a88023ad; the final local read finds five dirty skill/script/test files (+108/-9), superseding the earlier clean-checkout observation. Published checks all pass or skip; they do not qualify those local edits. Author-reported 1,455 regression checks, 83 review-focused checks, six probes and client-go evidence were not repeated. Plugin a477bced and its two dirty court-permission test files were rechecked and remain unchanged |
| EVPN repo-wide PR/source reads, beyond author search | #4/#5 merged; #3/#6/#7 imports open, #7 verify failing. Current verification covers planning/public safety; the later focused audit below adds substantive merge-discussion evidence |
| OLMv1 private prototypes | Preparatory templates exist, including incomplete RBAC; not delivered addon support |

Exact heads, returned checks and handoffs belong to [current-work.md](current-work.md).
Author-reported runs, source contracts, approvals and successful runtime qualification are different evidence types;
the refresh did not execute plugin tests, trials, builds or hosted reruns.

### Production artifact checks

Direct `skopeo inspect` verified the already-recorded exact 0.24.1 production bundle reference/version;
the [work map](current-work.md#release-recovery-and-time-sensitive-work) retains its digest.
Seven recorded 4.16–4.22 indexes were probed with `oc image extract`, each bounded to 100 seconds; all timed out, so membership is unknown.
`oc get` of all three recorded September component production Release names returned NotFound in the authenticated tenant.
Repository YAMLs retain intent/snapshot identities, not success verdicts. Recover catalog/QE/release proof before closeout;
these reads establish bundle publication, not end-to-end validation or artifact absence. No status skill used an inferred version.

Static conductor review supersedes several old roadmap claims: all build-readiness scripts are review level;
scripted steps can have external verifiers; `run_conductor` is extracted and has an integration test target;
bundle snapshot selection has a warn-only tag-age check; checkout restoration is implemented.
The [shortened roadmap](autorelease-step-automation.md) preserves remaining write-acknowledgement, snapshot-selection, retry and concurrency questions.
No implementation or external runtime was changed to test those questions.

## Public PR evidence

The audit fetched pull-request metadata for 347 unique PRs through GitHub's API, covering the three remediation lists and the initial epic-period search.

| Evidence | Verified result |
| --- | --- |
| Glasswing list | 113 URLs in the September inventory; 105 historical merges, 8 drafts open at that cutoff. October 7 direct reads find those eight closed unmerged on October 3; the earlier claim that all were still open on October 6 was incorrect |
| CVE/revert list | 43 unique PRs: 26 merged, 17 closed without merging; 3 are lint-only reverts, leaving 40 CVE-fix PRs |
| EC/Tekton list | 33 unique PRs: 32 merged, 1 closed without merging |
| Initial epic-period inventory | 335 PRs across 12 repositories; 290 merged, 32 closed without merging, 13 open at the reconstructed cutoff |
| Full August 4–September 30 UTC search | 343 PRs across 14 repositories; this includes work created after the initial sweep and is a different population |

The [public inventory](agentic-sdlc-jira-updates-payloads/submariner-sustenance/epic-period-prs.json) records an explicit cutoff of
2026-09-30 at 05:00 UTC. It was reconstructed from an author/date search and each PR's creation, close and merge timestamps, not captured live at that time.
A second pass fetched complete close, reopen and merge timelines for all 335 entries. No entry has a reopen event; replaying the events at the cutoff
confirms every recorded state and the initial aggregate. Merge is terminal even when GitHub emits a close event at the same timestamp.
Theme membership is heuristic and recorded per entry; category counts were recomputed from those entries. A closed state does not establish a supersession reason.

The complete-file statistics and merge dates of [release-management PR #109](https://github.com/stolostron/submariner-release-management/pull/109)
and [PR #110](https://github.com/stolostron/submariner-release-management/pull/110) match the plan. Their published validation sections support the
reported onboarding E2E and live RPM lockfile run; those runs were not independently repeated by this documentation audit.
[cve-agent PR #35](https://github.com/dfarrell07/claude-skills/pull/35) is merged;
[release-management PR #114](https://github.com/stolostron/submariner-release-management/pull/114) and
[OCP 5 FBC PR #82](https://github.com/stolostron/submariner-operator-fbc/pull/82) remain open.

## Kubernetes rebase evidence

The inventory is pinned to fork branch bak42 at `febb7974696e870f933e8ad3741605d31ead0b5c`; a remote-ref read confirms that backup exists.
At that committed snapshot: 134 files, 20,792 lines, 32 gate documents, four design/compatibility documents,
13 shell/Python scripts, 238 Python test functions and 16 pattern-retention cases. Hooks/gate scripts are outside the script count.
Bak42 adds 69 commits beyond PR `7e1aa060`; current HEAD adds another 13, plus two dirty test files.
The checked fork refs remain at the PR and bak42; neither backs up the entire current source.

GitHub verifies 108 closed July draft PRs across five repos and six June PRs (one merged).
The legacy local matrix has **536 rows** dated July 29–September 24, **218** for 1.36.2, with latest unmutated PASS summaries for all six targets.
The inspected matrix-state has no `evidence/` archive and only one run-input record. Those rows cannot establish current retained-evidence qualification;
Proposed K2 status stays In Progress pending per-target evidence/failure dispositions or an explicit limited-acceptance decision. PR counts are not counts of accepted runs.

Current eval source captures model/tokens/turns/cost but emits zeros when terminal metrics are missing; exclude that fallback from measurements.
The runner collects artifacts and does not execute YAML judges. The guide's $17–27 light/$40–60 heavy estimates are documented observations,
not a benchmark repeated here. K3 retains valid measurements/judge outcomes and the unanswered reviewer/shared-harness question.
That question is an [issue comment](https://github.com/openshift-eng/ai-helpers/pull/617#issuecomment-5587555534), not a review thread.
The [published Kubernetes v1.37.1 release](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.37.1) supports target availability, not a consumer result.

## Field and infrastructure evidence

The proposed-action audit read both projects' complete Story create metadata (ACM 81 fields, CORENET 21), project permissions,
and edit/transition metadata for 21 existing targets. All reads succeeded. Current project permissions allow create/edit/comment/link/assign/transition/resolve;
those permissions do not authorize writes on the user's behalf. Both Story type ids are 10009.
Reporter is required with a default; verify the approved/default reporter after creation.

| Action input | Verified result and correction |
| --- | --- |
| ACM creation | Component 33720, proposed priorities/Activity Types, `parent`, PR field, both point fields and sprint are writable. Use one membership path and read back the canary |
| CORENET creation | `parent`, proposed priority/Activity Type, Story Points and sprint are writable; legacy Epic Link, Original story points and Git Pull Request are absent. Set the latter two only in a subsequent edit after the new Story confirms support |
| CORENET edit support | Existing Stories 7062/7171/7615 expose Original story points and PR fields. Epic 7155 does not expose the PR field for editing; no epic PR-field edit is proposed |
| Related links | `Related`, id 10077, supports the proposed S1/ACM-45508, S1/OPGM-364 and K2/CORENET-7062 relationships. Check existing links before adding |
| Terminal transitions | Inspected closure-review targets require resolution. The epic and Story workflows differ; no transition id is reused, and no new Story's transitions can be verified before it exists |
| Comments | The authenticated account belongs to `Red Hat Employee`. REST supports initial restricted visibility; current `acli comment create` only exposes project-default visibility, so it is not the execution client for these comments |
| Sprint and points | Sprints 87579 and 87581 still report active. Story-point values and the story split remain proposed choices, not inferred approvals |

The duplicate/scope search found a closed broader Glasswing epic ACM-36285 with no children and related incidents,
not a matching shipyard-audit remediation story in the searched results. S5 now records that boundary instead of claiming no tracker exists.
Existing OCP readiness epic ACM-36458 has eight runtime-readiness children; S1 remains catalog/release onboarding, not those compatibility deliverables.
Existing Kubernetes delivery epic CORENET-7450 has nine children; CORENET-6983 retains 1.36 delivery scope.
K2/K4 qualify the plugin without recreating or changing those other-owned repository-bump tasks.
The September 13–30 Vulnerability JQL `BY currentUser()` returned 259 currently assigned closures earlier;
that historical population does not justify closing today's four private active cases.

The [epic edits](agentic-sdlc-jira-updates-payloads/submariner-sustenance/epic-description-edits.md) retain their own baseline/counting definitions.
[OCP rollout](ocp-5-0-fbc-rollout.md) owns immutable task/index inputs and expiry evidence;
[FBC recovery](fbc-failure-recovery.md) owns historical 401 diagnosis, prepared release-data render/regression results and prerequisite probes.
Earlier focused draft tests passed, but a full release-data warning-group failure reproduced on untouched cached main; the entire repository was not green.
Tenant/admission drafts still require fresh-base reads and separation of the tenant's unrelated documentation rewrite.

The latest authenticated namespace read returns zero PipelineRuns and 741 snapshots, down from the earlier 746. Six retained FBC snapshots match the pinned
4.x source and recover the exact scenario/run associations: all aggregate Failed/operator TestFail, with completed standard warnings.
The exact map belongs to [FBC recovery](fbc-failure-recovery.md#retained-snapshot-and-scenario-identities).
The registry Secret remains unlinked to the runner; OCP 5 Application/Component/build account are NotFound.
Credential usability and deployed controller/field ownership remain unverified. The earlier GitLab read failed DNS;
no fresh-base access is claimed and no credential contents were printed.

The retained 0.23.4 component-stage snapshot has nine components and aggregate TestSucceeded=True;
its recorded stage Release is currently Released=True/Succeeded, confirming evidence already in the parent comments.
The retained 0.22.2 candidate also passes aggregate integration with warnings. Direct immutable bundle inspection/extraction verifies
its v0.22.2 label and 0.22.2 CSV. Seven mapped related-image digests differ from the snapshot operands; registry copying can change digests,
so content identity remains unreconciled rather than proven invalid. The snapshot operator inspects as v0.22.2;
the embedded production operator inspection fails. Neither candidate selection nor EC/bundle acceptance is inferred.
The October 2 route-agent-0-21 push check succeeds at 82adbacd, while its retained EC scenario fails.
That supports review of the original build issue without claiming compliance or adding EC acceptance to its original scope.

## Execution limits

Before an authorized write, refresh issue/comments/ADF/PR evidence, project create/transition/resolution/link metadata,
acceptance criteria and chosen points/sprint. Create one reviewed canary, read it back and only then continue the epic sequence.
Set restricted comment visibility at creation and verify it. Preserve full original ADF and write ids for correction/read-back.
Do not repeat a fact already recorded, bulk-close private vulnerabilities, resolve unrelated test subtasks as release work,
or infer product compatibility/qualification/production from local packaging, source merges or Jira status.
No native build/E2E, plugin trial, tenant regression or hosted rerun was repeated. The direct artifact/retained-Release reads above were performed; they did not execute a release.

## Proposed-action disposition

| Proposed action | Review result |
| --- | --- |
| Existing comments and independent epic edits | First four comments posted; remaining missing deltas and epic edits are pending review; full target comments and original ADF checked. They do not wait for new story creation. Summaries using S/K placeholders must wait for real keys and accurately reflect completed writes |
| S1/S5 creation and In Progress | Scope remains unfinished. S5 acceptance now consistently allows explicitly accepted evidence-based re-triage; unmerged draft closure does not satisfy remediation. Recheck existing scope before creation |
| S2/S3/S4 creation and proposed Resolved | Delivered contracts and linked merges support acceptance review; transition only after the approved criteria and the new canary's workflow/resolution are verified |
| K1–K5 creation and In Progress | Qualification/measurement/upstream gaps remain. Corrected field setup separates create from post-create edit; chosen points, sprint and actual canary metadata are required |
| Release/legacy/research closure reviews | No immediate transition is proposed. Preserve original acceptance scope and recover missing build/fix/QE/catalog or research evidence; unrelated failures are separate investigations |
| ACM-37426 timeline correction | Exact title and description drafts are prepared; apply together only after confirming the 5.1 target and install/migration contract, preserving original reference links |
| Deferred/other-owned/private work | No bulk comment, duplicate task creation, reopening, other-owner transition or vulnerability closure is proposed |

Completeness check: every active assigned non-Vulnerability issue has a payload or an explicit review/defer disposition in the queue. ACM-34592/ACM-40644 remain acceptance reviews, not pending unconditional transitions. The four-comment first chunk is posted and verified; it did not depend on story creation or the PR-field canary. Its autorelease and CVE drafts each contain one complete comment; new-story, sprint/points, contribution inventory and acceptance decisions remain explicit gates. The Kubernetes epic describes evidence gates as a design contract, with enforcement and installed-runtime qualification still required. S1’s execution order now includes the already-planned lifecycle relationship alongside addon consumption, with duplicate-link checks and read-back; the audit draft links the open helper-pod prerequisite directly.

The content passes corrected these scope/claim problems:

* ACM-39736 requires **multiple** team members each to complete a release, with the maintainer not driving; gaps must be documented and fed back into improvements. The maintainer’s October 7 report that another team member has started using CVE/autorelease tooling is adoption evidence, not evidence of completed full releases or feedback. The three relevant comments and ownership-transfer description now include that milestone; S4 and all rollups retain the original acceptance scope.
* ACM-39738 requires contribution of **all generally relevant skills**. The CVE children retain their own criteria; the plugin remains on existing CORENET-7155 tracking. Parent acceptance requires an inventory reconciliation, without duplicate stories.
* ACM-45318 targets ART Go builders consumed through **Brew/OSBS**, not every Go builder. The addon has verified affected references; sampled UBI Go Toolset stages do not justify an independent-product migration by themselves. Shared/pipeline inputs must be checked before classifying another path as affected.
* CORENET-7615 records decision owners/dates **when decided**; it does not require every pending decision to be settled. Its separate reviewer-confirmation and three-conflict resolution criteria remain. Optional sections are consolidated into one update per target.
* Test-pod E2E and checkout restoration are scoped to the actual recorded runs/contracts. The audit's initial Won't Fix labels are classifications, not proof of owner-accepted risk dispositions.

Independent recomputation confirms the 335-entry historical inventory has 290 merged/32 closed/13 open across 12 repositories,
with 113 audit, 74 EC/Tekton and 68 CVE theme entries; all three PR-list sets belong to that inventory.
The pinned 0ed2981 baseline reproduces 18 skills, 51 scripts, 29 tests, one helper and 30,164 lines.
Primary PR reads confirm #109/#110 validation is author-reported; no onboarding runtime or RPM regeneration was repeated here.
The first-chunk audit matched each original acceptance scope and complete comment history, and confirmed issue-level Browse/Add Comments permission on all four targets plus restricted-group membership. The proposed deltas were absent before posting. Source review qualified BuildPLRInProgress handling, retained the observed retarget/artifact-refresh gap, and removed unrelated setup details and aggregate test-count prose from the conductor comment. All 43 historical CVE PRs still reconcile to 23 merged/17 closed fix PRs plus three merged lint reverts; the bounded closure query again returns 259. The approved CVE comment was refreshed before posting to Shipyard 3b67af1a: checks still running, two current unresolved threads, a current-head changes-requested review and no approval. The contribution drafts now use the focused next-chunk evidence below and still require a fresh pre-post read; no fresh runtime qualification is inferred.
OPGM's draft stays on lifecycle publication scope. New-story/client/workflow choices and acceptance decisions remain execution gates;
read-only verification cannot establish that a future write or transition succeeds.

## Prepared contribution approval chunk

The focused October 7 audit refreshed full documents and complete comments for ACM-39738/39739/39740, ACM-39729 and CORENET-7155. All three contribution targets remain New, with comment totals 0/1/1. The parent is a Story with the same two Sub-task children. Original criteria, parent links, issue-level Browse/Add Comments permissions and restricted-group membership were checked. The initial proposed order was ACM-39740, ACM-39739, then ACM-39738; the parent rollup was subsequently deferred as duplicative. Comments only, none posted. The 703-issue inventory above belongs to the preceding complete sweep.

Pinned Shipyard source at a88023ad already supports repository-registry configuration and native-command overrides. Child 39739 still requires project-level configuration, no hardcoded Submariner values and go-fix-cves merged into ai-helpers. Source PR #35 merged October 6 at 80c90e176244b6f84625778f7122e7a2c1993db3; its complete 11-file change and local source retain product-specific mappings, version references and Jira scope, including cve-jira-triage dependencies. Include those dependencies within child 39740's configuration review; preserve its own ai-helpers merge and non-Submariner CVE validation criteria.

The maintainer challenged the marketplace-overlap inference. A deeper static comparison read the loaded source contracts and deterministic scripts plus eight pinned marketplace implementation/dependency files. It establishes distinct workflow contracts:

| Marketplace workflow at a6271760 | Maintained workflow | Material distinction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [golang:fix-cve](https://github.com/openshift-eng/ai-helpers/blob/a62717603bcf5cc13b744d123a7cef5ab02992f3/plugins/golang/skills/fix-cve/SKILL.md) | Shipyard cve-fix at a88023ad | Supplied module/fix/CVE/ticket and compatibility-selected patching versus scanner-discovered findings, scripted per-location remediation/rollback, builder-aware stdlib handling and final build/rescan/PR gates |
| [compliance:analyze-cve](https://github.com/openshift-eng/ai-helpers/blob/a62717603bcf5cc13b744d123a7cef5ab02992f3/plugins/compliance/skills/analyze-cve/references/implementation.md) | CVE agent at 80c90e17 | One CVE/ticket per invocation, source govulncheck/call-graph report and optional fix versus recurring portfolio survey, shipped-image/provenance evidence, independent verification, prior-triage auditing and closure gating |
| [node-cve](https://github.com/openshift-eng/ai-helpers/blob/a62717603bcf5cc13b744d123a7cef5ab02992f3/plugins/node-cve/skills/analyze-cve-repos/SKILL.md) | CVE agent | Latest Node-team OCP version, downstream-branch reachability and Jira/Slack reporting versus all active product versions, shipped-image triage and gated issue actions |
| [golang:triage-fixed-cves](https://github.com/openshift-eng/ai-helpers/blob/a62717603bcf5cc13b744d123a7cef5ab02992f3/plugins/golang/skills/triage-fixed-cves/SKILL.md) | CVE agent | OCP release-payload Go-stdlib/toolchain cross-reference report versus product issue lifecycle and broader applicability/provenance verification |

Shared security vocabulary and basic operations do not establish interchangeable workflows or a contribution conflict. No demonstrated duplication justifies a reuse/composition gate. Removed that inferred prerequisite and the unrelated marketplace paragraphs from the three Jira drafts. This comparison inspected source; it did not execute either set of tools.

Parent 39738 covers all generally relevant skills. This candidate inventory needs owner classification, not automatic task creation:

| Candidate family | Existing scope / disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Maintained CVE-fix | ACM-39739; preserve project-level configuration and merge criteria |
| CVE agent and cve-jira-triage dependencies | ACM-39740; preserve per-product configuration and cross-product validation |
| Release tooling | 18 current skill definitions; classify relevance and product coupling before selecting contribution scope |
| Kubernetes rebase | CORENET-7155; [#617](https://github.com/openshift-eng/ai-helpers/pull/617) remains open/draft at 7e1aa060f3167de8a66e5191bf8e8692666c3ad4; preserve existing tracking |

## Prepared CI approval chunk

The October 7 focused audit read 35 full issue documents: CORENET-7086/7171, all 27 implementation subtasks, Prow scope 7083, plugin epic 7155 and supporting 7067/7081/7087/7089. Complete histories on the first 31 targets reconcile with reported totals. The proposed targets have 0/2 comments, Browse/Add Comments permission and confirmed restricted-group membership. Parent 7086 is To Do with exactly 28 children (research plus implementation); research 7171 is In Progress; all 27 implementation subtasks are To Do with no comments. The enclosing epic's Closed status does not establish child acceptance.

The research proposal already linked in the May comments was read directly at notes-source commit 723f6f4f683bc19cb72b0cb7c13c7821e501c3f1. It documents the five original research categories, rationale/adoption phases, goheader, CRD/Go compatibility checks and post-merge AI workflows. No tool health/version claims were revalidated or promoted to current recommendations. Corrected the drafts to treat header/API coverage as implementation handoffs, not missing research or new research acceptance criteria. Dependency licenses (7195) and API conventions (7174) do not substitute for those parent criteria; the 7173 curated-linter scope can accommodate header enforcement but does not explicitly confirm it.

The proposed GHA/Prow split is not settled by the research note: 7083 explicitly covers Prow presubmit/postsubmit/periodic jobs, and 7087 covers Prow image builds. Removed the exclusive cloud-E2E attribution; retained 7196/7197/7198's explicit post-merge boundary. No new subtask or scope reassignment is proposed. No implementation PR is linked in the 29 research/implementation issue documents. A direct openshift/mcn lookup returned 404 and an upstream organization listing identified no MCN-named target; those bounded reads do not prove repository or implementation absence. No published CI/runtime result is claimed.

The two comments add the created-task and handoff deltas without repeating the May survey or its existing research link. Proposed order is research 7171, then parent 7086. No comments or fields were written; contribution comments remain pending separately. The broader assigned-issue inventory retains its preceding audit date.

## Prepared EVPN approval chunk

The focused October 7 audit refreshed CORENET-7615 and the three named conflict issues (7501/7504/7505), including complete histories: all four are To Do with zero comments. Original criteria, issue-level comment permissions and restricted-group membership were checked. Six direct PR reads and complete changed-file pages confirm #2/#4/#5 merged and #3/#6/#7 open; #6 verify passes with tide pending, #7 verify fails. These implementation statuses are omitted from the planning comment.

A substantive [October 1 merge discussion](https://github.com/openshift/evpn-gateway-appliance/pull/2#issuecomment-5936707328) was missing from the preceding draft. It records preliminary artifact-graph feedback, the OpenShift FRR/frr-metrics choice with standalone/EVPN-metrics fixes, and a transit-VIF resolution for 7501. It links 7504/7505 to the payload decision and identifies a follow-up actor for still-pending product-home/cluster/AMI decisions. Responsibilities were explicitly deferred; the discussion does not clearly confirm release gates. PR #2 has no formal reviews or inline review comments, but that does not erase its substantive discussion or prove a lack of review.

Six published source files were read at main 306b8fe8a68cd878a9b8272b5329e5a6b8ac1e92, including the decision index, delivery/pipeline plans and Makefile. The decision index retains September 29 proposals; it has not incorporated the October 1 discussion. The three Jira descriptions also retain their old wording and are unassigned. Treat the discussion as existing decision evidence to reconcile with owner attribution, not a reason to declare all original criteria accepted or remake those decisions. No new requirement to settle every pending decision is introduced.

The public main source differs from the newer local checkout. A local ci-source.md is absent at the pinned published main; it was not used as published evidence. No appliance build, AWS qualification, release or repository change was executed. The shortened comment links PR #2 and the exact discussion, preserves To Do, and leaves related-issue/decision-index edits outside this approval chunk. All earlier pending chunks remain pending.

## Grouped approval order

The October 7 organization pass reviewed the assigned queue, all 14 portfolio targets, the optional URL-conversion draft, four posted comment records, five ACM epic edits, ten proposed stories, both epic summaries and their supporting work/evidence plans. The [queue](jira-update-queue.md#approval-order) now owns one order, starting with established comments and ending with new tracking and acceptance reviews. Portfolio sections follow that order; duplicate chunk tables were removed from the execution plan.

Existing comment and description payloads retain their text and criteria. Only organization/instructions changed. The merged CVE-agent update precedes the mutable CVE-fix update; the parent remains last. New ACM tracking keeps S4 as canary, then S2/S3 before unfinished S1/S5. Epic descriptions need no new keys, while summaries still do. Optional metric edits follow substantive edits; verification checks only the edits actually approved.

All 76 active non-Vulnerability dispositions and posted ids remain intact. This pass used the preceding audited Jira/PR records; it did not perform a new live sweep, approve writes, post comments, create tasks or transition issues. Target evidence and permissions still require refresh immediately before an approved action.

## Final plan review

The final October 7 read repeated the unrestricted 703-issue inventory and fetched 228 full non-Vulnerability documents (all 220 assigned, plus eight related), complete comment histories on 27 targets (315 comments, including all 159 on ACM-40644), both projects’ complete Story create metadata and 20 targets’ edit/transition metadata. Assigned keys/statuses and compared scope fields remain unchanged. The four posted comments match their recorded text, clickable links and restricted visibility. Epic membership/duplicate searches remain unchanged; restricted-group membership was verified through the authenticated account’s groups. This pass performed no Jira writes or private vulnerability triage.

Twenty-two direct PR reads and complete Shipyard review-thread pagination supersede the earlier running-check/no-current-review observations: #2582 at a88023ad has 46 successful/three skipped checks, current-head changes requested and three current unresolved threads. Fresh tenant reads retain all six documented failed FBC associations, both nine-component candidate verdicts and the successful component-stage Release. The registry link and OCP 5 resources are still absent; GitLab DNS remains unavailable. No credential usability, archived task diagnosis, installation, QE or new release was established.

The execution plan now separates creation from terminal acceptance, handles uncertain write results before retrying and checks changed baselines before edits/rollback. Posted payloads remain fixed historical records. The epic deny-rule wording now distinguishes minimum-version repair from catalog replacement. Independent recomputation confirms the 335-entry historical totals and all three PR-list memberships; runtime claims retain their original evidence limits.

## Second plan review

The repeated October 7 read again returned 703 assigned issues, 228 full non-Vulnerability documents and all 315 comments across 27 complete histories.
Compared issue scope/status fields, histories, epic membership and duplicate-search totals are unchanged. Authenticated restricted-group membership remains confirmed.
Direct FBC main/PR reads confirm the recovery source and #82 head/checks remain unchanged; the PR's reported base object is not used as current-main evidence.

A read-only synthetic probe of `fbc_tests_passed` accepts just the two required `BuildPLRInProgress` markers without completion evidence (exit 0).
The existing focused suite also passes all 16 checks. This demonstrates helper acceptance, not an end-to-end verifier or live release failure.
Source review confirms the verifier omits snapshot aggregate conditions and chooses the latest matching snapshot, even with a source pin;
stage generation repeats that selection. The recovery plan now requires fresh finished/successful verdicts, returned scope/name comparison and generated-YAML identity review.
No script, snapshot, release or posted comment changed.

The pending lifecycle-status comment now retains the original prohibition on new OpenShift 5 compatibility statements, distinguishes the release reference
from package-publication proof and preserves the permitted team IIB/catalog alternative. S1 explicitly keeps that existing publication acceptance separate
from its broader runtime scope. The queue's refresh count now matches the latest 220 assigned plus eight related documents;
private vulnerability inspection remains attributed to the earlier comprehensive sweep.

## Payload usefulness review

The review compared pending existing-issue comments with their original criteria and complete histories. Nineteen fresh full issue reads and all 27 complete
comment histories are unchanged. Group 1 is now one short correction on CORENET-7171: the implementation tasks exist and the AI scope is post-merge.
The parent CI comment, CVE contribution-parent rollup and older CVE progress draft are deferred because they repeat visible tracking or existing updates.
Their coverage, inventory and scope decisions remain in the queue. Execution guidance now requires a distinct missing fact or requested answer before posting;
audit checklists and acceptance instructions belong in the plan. No Jira write or acceptance change is performed.

The fresh contribution read also finds Shipyard #2582 advanced to 4fa703b3, matching clean local HEAD. The previously dirty five-file delta is now published.
The final refresh returns 45 successful and three skipped checks, a changes-requested review on this head, and four current/four outdated unresolved threads
out of 41; no current-head approval is recorded. Pending text and the work map now reflect this source change; qualification was not rerun.

The remaining review shortens 23 pending payload blocks from 2,664 to 1,324 words. Release comments retain newly recovered identities
and unreconciled evidence; builder/lifecycle comments retain their concrete inventory or requested status. New-story comments keep delivery PRs and relevant
qualification limits; epic summaries introduce the new keys instead of copying child inventories. Audit/duplicate checks move outside posted descriptions,
and S1's done/not-done annotations move from acceptance criteria to progress. Acceptance requirements remain unchanged. The exact four posted blocks and
historical inventories are preserved. Fresh EVPN main/decision-index reads confirm the unreconciled proposals; plugin source still has the same HEAD and two dirty tests.

Optional epic edits 1/2 now replace stale file/line/test totals with verified operation and validation scope. K1's scope likewise names tests instead of
using a dated test-function count. Historical counting methods remain recorded; no tracking creation or acceptance criterion is removed.

## Duplicate epic-summary review

Fresh October 7 reads confirm both epics remain In Progress, their descriptions and complete histories are unchanged (one/six comments),
and their child searches still return ten/zero stories. The pass removes both automatic epic-summary drafts and their execution steps. They repeat the new child keys, delivery PRs
and qualification limits already carried by the children. A separate missing decision, delivery or blocker can justify a later epic comment;
creating tracking alone does not. The new-story baseline comments, all acceptance requirements, four posted records and historical inventories remain intact.
The queue, portfolio instructions and payload index now agree; no placeholder-key summary is left to post. Earlier preparation records above describe superseded drafts.

## Action-scoped preflight review

The execution plan now reconciles completed epic edits before story creation: a description written in group 6 must not fail the later empty-description audit check. ACM edits check only their approved pending snippet/heading and preserve earlier writes.
Preflight is limited to the approved Jira group's targets, mutable claims and field prerequisites. Verified historical populations
retain their source/cutoff; their counting recipes remain available for a correction or expanded audit. Creating plugin tracking no longer requires
backing up unrelated working-tree changes first. Source preservation remains required before authorized engineering changes/publication, and frozen-source,
loaded-runtime and retained-budget checks remain required before fresh qualification. Story descriptions, baseline comments and acceptance criteria are unchanged.
No plugin backup, push, test or qualification was performed by this documentation review.

## Canary completion and PR-field review

The creation sequences previously created the remaining stories before posting the canary's restricted baseline comment, and later PR-field steps
unconditionally resumed writes after a comment-only fallback. Both sequences now finish canary field/comment read-backs before further creations;
then finish each story's approved field/comment writes before the next. Unsupported PR fields retain their links in restricted comments;
failed or mismatched writes still stop for reconciliation. Field edits preserve existing rich text and links, and mandatory CORENET points remain required.

Fresh October 7 create metadata again returns 81 ACM and 21 CORENET fields; CORENET's PR and Original story points fields remain absent at creation.
Both sampled Story edit-metadata reads expose the PR field with `set` only. The installed CLI still offers default comment visibility without a restriction flag.
New issues require their own metadata and actual canary read-backs; this review performed no create, comment, field edit or transition.
All story/epic payload blocks, posted records and historical inventories remain unchanged.

## First-batch readiness audit

Before posting, the focused October 7 audit re-read 34 full issue documents and complete histories (three comments total), including the research, all 27 implementation
subtasks, parent epic and adjacent Prow/image/release scope. CORENET-7171 remains In Progress with the same two May comments and ten changelog events;
its Browse/Add Comments permissions and restricted-group membership are confirmed. The two existing comments use the required group visibility.
CORENET-7086 still has exactly the research plus 27 implementation subtasks; all implementation issues remain To Do with no comments.

All 27 were created May 20 after the research comments; the draft now dates that fact instead of implying recent implementation work.
CORENET-7196/7197/7198 and the unchanged linked proposal at `723f6f4f683bc19cb72b0cb7c13c7821e501c3f1` explicitly specify post-merge workflows on push to main.
The comment describes their scope and release-note suggestions without claiming a new approval, implemented workflows or research completion.
Prepared ADF matches the exact draft, links six issue references, sets the required initial visibility and validates against the [published Atlassian schema](https://go.atlassian.com/adf-json-schema).
One restricted comment is ready for review; parent comments, fields, status transitions and new issues remain outside this batch. No Jira write was performed.

## Approved first batch posted

After explicit approval, fresh target/parent/AI-scope reads, complete comments, permissions and restricted membership matched the reviewed baseline.
CORENET-7171 comment `18824859` was created October 7 at **22:59:33 UTC** with `Red Hat Employee` visibility in the initial request.
Jira's rendered view mangled adjacent links on the abbreviated `7197/7198` labels. An authorized correction of the same owned comment at **23:02:14 UTC**
removed those two hyperlink marks, preserving every approved text character and the restriction; no second comment was created.

Read-back verifies exact approved text in both ADF and rendered HTML, four working full-key links, restricted visibility and unchanged In Progress status.
The complete history has three comments: both May records are unchanged and the approved correction appears exactly once. All other issue fields are unchanged.
Group 1 is complete; group 2 remains the next separate approval batch. No parent comment, field edit, transition or issue creation was performed.
Keep abbreviated numeric suffixes plain and verify actual rendered text/links, not only stored ADF. Raw requests, responses and the receipt remain outside this checkout.

## Second-batch readiness audit

The focused October 7 audit reads seven full Jira documents, all 12 comments and 63 changelog events: the contribution parent/children, hardening/adoption stories and both relevant epics. The parent remains New with exactly the same two Sub-task children; both children remain New with one old comment each. Their descriptions, original criteria, statuses, hierarchy and complete comments are unchanged. The two missing contribution updates remain useful on the children; earlier hardening/adoption comments are preserved and no duplicate parent rollup is proposed. Both targets permit Browse/Add Comments and the authenticated maintainer belongs to `Red Hat Employee`.

Agent source #35 merged October 6; the merge tree and current main are `3ee5ddaaf40f49839cfce5e35a901e7c1ce5eaac` (PR head `80c90e17`). Review covers all 11 changed files plus six agent/triage dependencies. The payload accurately describes applicability/provenance, version/source mapping, mixed outcomes and digest handling. Component/image mappings, RHACM version rules, Jira scope and sibling triage helpers still contain product-specific values. Source hardening does not establish per-product configuration, an ai-helpers merge or validation on another product’s CVE issues.

Shipyard #2582 is open at `453dbbb47ad189b86d811aeff0c18b71115126e1`. The **23:11 UTC** snapshot returns 44 successful/three skipped checks, with no current-head review or approval. Latest changes requested is on `4fa703b3`; complete pagination returns 41 threads, two unresolved/current and four unresolved/outdated. Direct old/new tree comparison finds only three changed files (workflow, reviewer and tests); the force-pushed squash’s merge-base comparison is not that delta. Review covers all 32 extant changed files. Project-level `.cve-fix.yaml` and registry configuration already exist; the revised comment credits them instead of listing configuration wholesale as unfinished. The built-in Shipyard builder-image fallback remains Submariner-specific and needs resolution against the original contribution criterion.

Three bounded source probes verify project-config parsing, YAML state normalization and workspace sync with `GOFLAGS=-mod=mod` on local Go 1.26.8. These probes do not reproduce the two current reviewer allegations; they do not resolve threads, establish all supported-toolchain behavior or repeat the PR’s full regression/live qualification. The proposed comment reports unresolved review state without asserting either allegation is a confirmed defect.

The ai-helpers main tree remains `a6271760`; its complete tree, all 35 open PRs and maintainer-authored PR search contain no delivery of these two maintained workflows. Three pinned marketplace contracts retain the previously reviewed distinct scopes; similar CVE skill names do not establish these issues’ acceptance. A broad Jira candidate search is discovery evidence only, not a cross-product validation result.

Batch 2 remains exactly ACM-39740 → ACM-39739, comments only with initial restricted visibility; no parent comment, field edit or transition. Refresh mutable evidence before the separately authorized write and finish each rendered text/link/visibility read-back before the next. Both prepared ADF requests validate against the published schema, match the exact draft text and link their PR once; each includes the group restriction in its initial payload. Only the pending CVE-fix comment changed; all five posted records, other pending blocks and original story/epic criteria are preserved. Prepared requests and raw evidence remain outside this checkout. No Jira write or implementation change was performed.

## Third-batch readiness audit

The focused October 7 audit refreshes five full Jira documents and all their comments/changelogs: CORENET-7615, its parent and the three named conflicts. The planning Story and three conflicts remain To Do with no comments; the parent remains In Progress with two comments. The target retains its original four acceptance criteria, assigned owner and parent. Browse/Add Comments and restricted-group membership are confirmed. An additional full CORENET-7621 read and its three comments retain the OpenShift FRR-image criterion and record the RHEL 10-only import scope; they do not record a host-FRR replacement decision.

Planning #2 merged October 1 at `5321a8c5`; published main remains `306b8fe8`. All 35 planning files are byte-identical to the merged tree; only Makefile and Dockerfile.root differ among the 38 fetched files. Complete PR history has three issue comments, no formal reviews and no inline review comments. The substantive [October 1 discussion](https://github.com/openshift/evpn-gateway-appliance/pull/2#issuecomment-5936707328) was posted after the merge: it records a preliminary artifact-graph look, the FRR/frr-metrics choice and required standalone/EVPN-metrics changes, and the transit-VIF resolution. It explicitly leaves responsibilities for later and does not clearly confirm release gates. Absence of formal reviews does not erase that feedback.

All six adjacent PRs (#3–8), complete changed-file/comment pages and returned reviews were inspected. #4/#5 are merged; #3/#6/#7/#8 remain open. Open #6 at `629d9e67` changes the decision index to label RHEL 10 host-installed FRR settled, and its Containerfile installs the `frr` package. No returned review approves that payload change; CORENET-7621 still says to use the OpenShift FRR image. The revised comment links this concrete pending proposal for owner reconciliation rather than treating its “settled” label as an accepted replacement. Its seven current files were read at the pinned head. Build and qualification status are not inferred from source or verify checks.

The public index still carries September 29 proposals with proposed role owners. A prepared branch contains October 1 decision-record amendments: fork `2fbdebbe` is publicly reachable, and its index blob matches the inspected local snapshot `22dc3d2`. It is not merged to main and remains draft evidence, not an accepted plan update. Its own record says the discussion named no decision owner. Keep the recorded outcomes and remaining owner/date attribution distinct: do not ask the team to remake the existing choice, and do not require every pending product-home/cluster/AMI decision to be settled. Acceptance still permits reviewer confirmation **or requested changes made**, and owner corrections **or an owner-attributed resolution**; issue-description edits are not the only completion path.

The transit-VIF interpretation matches [AWS’s Direct Connect/Transit Gateway guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/direct-connect-transit-gateways.html). No appliance build, AWS operation, EVPN repository change or qualification run was performed. This batch remains one restricted comment on CORENET-7615, preserving To Do; no related-issue/index edit or transition. Batch 2 remains reviewed and unposted. Refresh target/history, published main, the cited discussion and open #6 before the separately approved write; verify rendered text/links and visibility afterward. The prepared ADF validates against the published schema, preserves the exact visible text and has three exact clickable links; Markdown link labels are converted rather than posted literally, and trailing punctuation stays outside the raw PR URL. Initial visibility is restricted. Only this pending EVPN comment changed; all posted records, batch-2 drafts and original story/epic payloads are preserved. Raw evidence and prepared requests stay outside this checkout.

## EVPN handoff deprioritized

The October 7 maintainer instruction moves group 3 to the end of the approval queue, after acceptance/closure reviews. Group identifiers stay fixed; queue rows and portfolio sections now show the revised priority. Group 2 remains next, followed by group 4 deadline/status work. The maintainer reports another EVPN planning PR iteration is WIP and will start CI PRs soon; this is current-work context, not a new merge or qualification claim. No PR URL is inferred from the earlier fork snapshot.

The reviewed EVPN comment is retained unchanged as a deferred draft and must be refreshed before review/posting. All posted records, other pending payloads, acceptance criteria and write boundaries are preserved. No Jira write was performed.

## Deadline/status batch readiness audit

The focused October 7 read covers five full Jira documents (both targets, their parents and ART-14300), all 41 comments and 153 changelog events. ACM-45318 remains New with no comments; OPGM-364 remains In Progress with only its two unanswered September requests. Original descriptions, criteria, hierarchy and statuses are preserved. Both targets permit Browse/Add Comments and the authenticated maintainer belongs to `Red Hat Employee`. The initial draft used “At Risk” as an assessment without changing workflow status; the October 8 revision below supersedes that wording.

The source scan covers 35 branch/ref reads, 33 distinct pinned trees and 8,027 non-vendored text files across seven repositories. All 18 ticket-listed downstream component Dockerfiles and their push/PR selections use UBI Go Toolset; no named direct Brew/ART builder reference was found in those or devel source trees. Addon reads extend through 2.10–2.17, 4.23 and 5.0–5.2/main, plus the distinct appstudio 2.14 branch. The refreshed inventory records missing streams, that branch’s Go 1.23 builder, per-module floors and push/PR architecture differences. All table pins/floors match fresh sources. The parent already documents replacement tag families and internal entitlement; supported build sources, usable credentials, actual compiler/crypto behavior and platform builds still require qualification. Task-ref #2792 remains open against appstudio 2.14 and changes only two pipeline files. The 15 returned open addon PRs contain no builder-migration title; this search does not establish absence of other unpublished work.

FBC #81 merged September 29 at `070f617c`; main remains `2e6b489e`. #82 remains open, not marked draft, at `1e8b3c26`: six Actions checks and DCO pass, Konflux fails at init, and Tide still needs LGTM. The published check preserves `PodCreationFailed` for the missing build account. Live tenant reads confirm absent 5.0 Application/Component/account, no retained PipelineRuns or target-labelled snapshots, and the registry credential remains unlinked in both integration-runner lists. The original failed run is NotFound; there are no fresh task logs to inspect. Four configuration worktrees remain clean at their recorded heads, but GitLab main still fails DNS. A local draft and absent live resources do not prove current remote merge status; the comment now asks for reconciliation without asserting a live unmerged state.

Both #82 pipelines pass the source-order/result-forwarding checks for lifecycle injection before OPM. Main’s provisional catalog has no added OCP 5 compatibility text. Current acceptable-bundles data, with verified manifest/layer hashes, matches all 12 task refs; five now have expiries, including deprecated-image-check on November 6. The October 30/31 dates persist. The [rollout plan](ocp-5-0-fbc-rollout.md#3-reconcile-82-and-verify-its-build) pins the refreshed data and retains deny-rule/EC verification as a separate gate. Neither trust membership nor source/Actions checks establish a successful lifecycle build/release. The target’s prohibition on new 5.0 compatibility statements and alternative team IIB/catalog proof remain exact. Parent guidance on full 4.22/5.0 support at GA is a separate product qualification requirement.

Group 4 remains exactly ACM-45318 → OPGM-364, two restricted comments with no field edit or transition. Both prepared ADF requests validate against the published schema, match exact visible draft text and link targets, and carry restricted visibility in the initial request. Only these two pending payload blocks changed; all five posted records, other drafts and original story/epic criteria are preserved. The inventory link pins the reviewed source-plan commit. Refresh mutable evidence before the separately approved write and finish each rendered text/link/visibility read-back before the next. No Jira write, PR #82 edit, cluster mutation, migration build or release was performed. Raw evidence and prepared requests remain outside this checkout; group 2 stays next in approval order and EVPN stays deferred.

## Lifecycle status clarity

The October 8 revision describes the verified state: lifecycle publication is pending and tenant configuration blocks the build. The request lists “In / At Risk / Out” without defining them, and the available evidence establishes neither delivery confidence nor a threatened deadline. The draft therefore assigns no program label. It retains pending work, explicitly dated build/tenant/DNS blockers, unverified registry access, the prohibition on new 5.0 compatibility statements and both allowed catalog-proof paths. Merged preparation is separate from release completion. This is a factual comment draft, not a Jira workflow transition.

Only this pending comment changed. Its revised ADF validates against the published schema with exact visible text, two exact PR links and initial restricted visibility. The builder draft, all posted records and other payloads/criteria are preserved. October 7 source/blocker evidence remains dated; refresh it before a separately approved post. No Jira write was performed.

## Approved lifecycle comment posted

On October 8, explicit approval authorized only the revised lifecycle comment on OPGM-364. Preflight refreshed its full document, complete two-comment/five-event histories, Browse/Add Comments permissions and employee-group membership. The target remained In Progress. FBC #81 remains merged and #82 remains open at the reviewed head with the published missing-account failure; the live tenant still lacks the 5.0 Application, Component and build account. GitLab main still fails DNS. The approved dated text is unchanged and adds a missing answer without assigning an undefined program label.

Exactly one POST created comment **18829498** at **09:37:06 UTC**, with `Red Hat Employee` visibility in the initial request. Read-back verifies exact ADF, every visible character in rendered HTML, both PR links and the restriction. The complete history now has three comments; both earlier comments and all five changelog events are unchanged. Editable issue fields and In Progress status are unchanged. Watch metadata changed from not watching/two watchers to watching/three watchers; no explicit watcher operation was performed. No formatting correction, second comment, field edit or transition was needed.

The exact block is now a fixed posted record. Group 4 is partial: ACM-45318 remains pending and was not posted. Group 2 remains next in approval priority and EVPN remains deferred. Other payloads, all earlier posted records and original acceptance criteria are preserved. No cluster mutation, build, release or external PR #82 edit was performed. Raw requests/responses and the receipt stay outside this checkout.

## Release-evidence batch readiness audit

The focused October 8 review reads both release parents and all 32 children: 34 full documents, all 129 comments and 282 changelog events. Both parents remain In Progress. The 0.23.4 catalog step remains In Progress and FBC stage/QE/production/URL steps remain New. The 0.22.2 EC and bundle steps remain In Progress, with stage onward New; an older completed EC record does not override the later in-progress record. The two extra test subtasks retain their separate disposition. Both targets permit Browse/Add Comments and the authenticated maintainer belongs to `Red Hat Employee`.

The 0.23.4 parent’s September 30 comment already records component-stage success, catalog source, failed operator tests and the registry diagnosis. Repeating those facts adds no useful delta. The revised comment links only the exact six-snapshot/scenario/run recovery map at a pinned plan commit. Fresh tenant reads retain all six single-component snapshots at source `2e6b489e`, Finished=True and aggregate Failed, with completed operator TestFail results; completed standard warnings do not pass that gate. The namespace returns 741 snapshots, zero PipelineRuns and zero Releases; the registry secret remains absent from both integration-runner credential lists. The recorded component-stage Release is now NotFound, while its archived October 7 Released=True/Succeeded read remains evidence. Plans distinguish those dates rather than erasing historical success. Six catalog extractions timed out at 90 seconds each; a corrected directory-path retry of 4.19 also timed out. Catalog content and intended bundle membership remain unverified. The task-expiry row now matches the rollout plan’s five expiring pins and dates.

The nine-component October 2 candidate passes aggregate integration with a completed combined EC/standard warning result. Fresh amd64 registry reads confirm bundle and operator labels v0.22.2 at their distinct recorded source commits. A fresh immutable bundle extraction verifies CSV version 0.22.2 and all seven related-image comparisons; the CSV matches both pinned source trees exactly. Distinct commits therefore do not establish a manifest conflict. All seven production digests differ from the snapshot operands, and a read of the CSV’s exact embedded operator reference returns `manifest unknown`. These reads do not establish registry content equivalence, invalid content or all-platform qualification. Snapshot AutoReleased=True explicitly records a skipped automatic release for both inspected component snapshots. Neither condition proves release success.

The candidate is absent from complete parent/child histories and remains unselected. Its comment is conditional on confirming release relevance; no snapshot, EC result, bundle mapping or parent artifact is accepted by this audit. The unconditional batch is one recovery-map comment, with no six-subtask repetition, field edit or transition. Both prepared requests validate against the published ADF schema, preserve exact visible text and the recovery-map link, and set employee visibility in the initial request. Only the two group 5 drafts changed; all six fixed posted blocks, other pending payloads and original criteria are preserved. No Jira write, cluster mutation, rerun, release or qualification run was performed. Raw exports, registry reads and prepared requests stay outside this checkout. Group 2 remains next in approval priority and EVPN remains deferred.

## Release draft clarity

The October 8 clarity pass uses the exact Jira titles, **Release Submariner 0.23.4** and **Release Submariner 0.22.2**, with target keys retained for execution. The recovery comment names the map's snapshot, operator-scenario and failed-run entries. The shortened comments link full source/digest details in pinned evidence. The candidate comment retains passing snapshot tests with warnings, the 0.22.2 bundle, unverified production images, the exact registry error and the digest-comparison limit. Source-CSV agreement and separate image-label/CSV versions remain in the evidence. Its relevance and release readiness remain unresolved. The candidate is explicitly on hold; review of the recovery comment does not authorize the held draft.

Every revised claim matches the retained October 8 snapshot, immutable bundle extraction, image labels, source CSVs and seven-image comparison. This is a wording review of that dated evidence, not a new live release audit. Both revised ADF requests validate against the published schema with exact visible text, both pinned evidence links and initial employee visibility. Only the two group 5 payloads changed; all six posted records, other drafts and original criteria are preserved. No Jira write or release operation was performed.

## Approved recovery-map comment posted

Explicit approval authorized the ready recovery-map comment on **Release Submariner 0.23.4**; the **Release Submariner 0.22.2** candidate remained on hold. Fresh preflight re-read the full target, all 90 comments and ten changelog events, permissions and employee-group membership. The target remained In Progress with unchanged scope, and the map delta was absent. The pinned recovery plan remains accessible and contains the six recorded snapshot identities. Konflux authentication expired before this preflight, so no fresh snapshot verdict is claimed; the approved comment describes the recorded map.

Exactly one POST created comment **18830594** on ACM-44527 at **10:43:08 UTC** October 8, with `Red Hat Employee` visibility in the initial request. Read-back verifies exact approved ADF, visible text, rendered HTML and its pinned link. Complete history now has 91 comments; all 90 prior comments and ten changelog events are unchanged. In Progress status, all other editable fields and watch metadata are unchanged; only comment content/count and the issue update timestamp differ.

The payload is now a fixed posted record. Group 5 is partial, with the candidate comment still unposted and requiring confirmation of release relevance. Plans and queue agree on that scope; group 2 remains next in approval priority and EVPN remains deferred. All earlier posted blocks, other drafts and original criteria are preserved. No Jira field edit, transition, second comment, cluster mutation, rerun or release was performed. Raw exports, requests, read-backs and receipt stay outside this checkout.

## Independent epic-description readiness audit

The October 8 review covers **Submariner Sustenance Automation** and **Create agents to automate the bump**, plus their children and release/qualification dependencies: 20 full documents, all 329 comments and 199 changelog events. Both epics remain In Progress; their full descriptions are unchanged from the previous read. The first has ten children and the second none, with an empty description. Both permit Browse/Edit Issues and expose `description` with `set`; no story creation, field setup or status change is needed for this batch.

The Submariner draft now corrects all four related release-automation/evidence paragraphs together. The old production bullet was duplicated under deliverables, and apply-only gate wording appeared twice; conductor dispatch and step metadata retain review, gate and manual stops. Full tracker histories add no catalog/QE closeout proof to the dated 0.24.1 bundle-publication evidence. Ownership-transfer wording preserves multiple releasers and feedback requirements, and describes shared credential setup without promising credential-free operation. Deliverable additions omit brittle counts and duplicate prerequisite setup; qualification limits remain explicit. #109/#110 and FBC #81 remain merged, while #82 and the upgrade/helper-pod prerequisites remain open; all eight FIND-006 drafts remain closed unmerged. `make test-skills` passes 19 checks with the same five debt entries. Optional metric edits stay behind the substantive edits.

The Kubernetes description is shorter with unchanged scope and all four acceptance criteria. A new source read finds #617 draft at `1a33dafe`, 143 changed files, the same WIP/invalid-OWNERS/needs-ok-to-test labels and no current-head review. Complete pagination returns 175 reviews, 14 issue comments and 223 inline review comments. The current archive contains 138 plugin files and 32 gate documents. Direct blob comparisons find 99 differences from the old PR head, 46 from bak42 and only the two court-test files differing from October 7 committed source `a477bced`. The rewritten history makes ancestry counts unsuitable for judging published content. The previously local code is now published; plans and dated K1/K4/K5 progress payloads reflect that fact. Local dirty state was not re-read. Current compatibility/source contracts retain historical trial limits and fresh installed-runtime qualification requirements; publication alone supplies no new accepted rebase or measurement result.

All seven old replacement paragraphs and the insertion heading match exactly once in the live ADF. Five independent Submariner edit requests and the empty Kubernetes description request validate against the published schema. Sequential simulations preserve unrelated nodes, original emphasis, nested bullets and links, and all 120 edit orders yield the same final document. Each actual request must be rebuilt from a fresh live baseline after earlier edits. All seven fixed posted blocks, other portfolio drafts and all five K-story acceptance blocks are unchanged. No Jira write, plugin mutation/test, model call, release operation or qualification run was performed. Raw exports, source archives, comparisons and prepared requests remain outside this checkout; group 2 remains next in approval priority, the candidate remains on hold and EVPN stays deferred.

## Original design and working coverage clarification

The October 8 maintainer clarification states that the original epic supplied no specification, that the entire architecture/workflow is the maintainer's innovation, and that the plugin is fully working across all six CoreNet repositories on the three earlier versions, now also working for 1.37. The draft now credits that original design explicitly in the maintainer's voice and records the reported functional coverage. Before the approved edit, Jira had an empty description and no description changes in all 23 changelog events; the three published configurations target 1.34.1, 1.35.3 and 1.36.2. These checks support the empty-specification baseline and version identities; the coverage and authorship clarification comes from the maintainer, not a fresh independent run.

The epic's scope now includes the three earlier versions and working 1.37 support. All four proposed acceptance criteria remain unchanged. Plans distinguish implemented/working functionality from retained evidence acceptance, runtime qualification, measured eval outcomes and upstream merge. Historical trial limitations stay dated rather than being used to imply the plugin remains unimplemented. Only the epic introduction/scope and K1's pending progress comment changed in the payload; other story criteria, Submariner description edits, all seven posted records and portfolio drafts are preserved. The revised description and comment validate against ADF with exact visible text. No Jira write, plugin modification or qualification run was performed.

## Approved Kubernetes epic description applied

After explicit approval, the exact description for **Create agents to automate the bump** was applied October 8 at 11:23:37 UTC, changelog `92306194`. Fresh preflight read the full issue, all six comments and 23 changelog events, zero children, edit metadata and Browse/Edit Issues permissions. The description was still empty with no previous description changes. An immediate full-field comparison confirmed no intervening issue change; exactly one description-only PUT returned 204.

Read-back verifies exact approved ADF and all 13 rendered text blocks, including nine bullets and two italic headings. The original design credit and reported working coverage are unchanged from the approved draft. All six comments, all 23 prior changelog events, every other issue field, watch metadata and zero-child membership are preserved; status remains In Progress. Only `description` and `updated` changed, with one new description history event. Authorship and functional coverage remain the maintainer’s report; this write does not establish a fresh qualification matrix or upstream merge.

The description is a fixed applied record, separate from the seven posted comments. Group 6 is partial: all Submariner epic edits remain pending. K1–K5 and their comments remain uncreated/unposted; their criteria and all other payload blocks are unchanged. Group 2 remains next, the release candidate remains on hold and EVPN stays deferred. No other Jira write, story creation, transition, plugin change, qualification run or release operation was performed. Raw preflight, request, read-back and receipt remain outside this checkout.

## Contribution batch refreshed October 8

The next queued batch remains two child comments: **Contribute generalized CVE agent to openshift/ai-helpers**, then **Contribute go-fix-cves to openshift/ai-helpers**. Fresh reads cover seven full issues, all 12 comments and 64 changelog events, including the already-applied Kubernetes epic description. The six other issues retain exact descriptions, original criteria, hierarchy and complete comments/history. Both contribution children remain New with one old comment each; the parent has the same two Sub-tasks and no comments. The proposed progress remains absent. Both comment permissions and employee-group membership are confirmed; no duplicate parent/adoption/remediation update is proposed.

Agent #35 remains merged at `3ee5ddaa`, which is also current main. All 11 changed files and six agent/triage dependencies were rechecked. The preparatory applicability, provenance, source/version, mixed-outcome and digest claims still match source; per-product component/image mappings, version rules, Jira scope and triage dependencies remain the generalization scope. Neither this merge nor the reported initial adoption establishes the required ai-helpers merge or another product’s CVE-issue validation.

Shipyard #2582 remains open at `b347a44d43b7386eef1a26e6d7114670324344bd`, confirmed again after source review. All 33 changed-file entries (32 extant files), 43 reviews, 58 issue comments and 64 inline comments were read with complete pagination. Of 45 review threads, zero are unresolved/current and six unresolved/outdated. Latest changes requested is on `edae89bb`; no current-head review or approval is recorded. The October 8, 11:31 UTC complete check read has 19 runs (13 successful, three skipped, three running) and one successful commit status. These observations supersede the old two-current-thread/passing-check snapshot; running checks are not a finished verdict.

Direct blob comparison against the October 7 `453dbbb4` tree finds six changed files, covering workspace sync before vendor/build with bounded tidy/vendor/sync failures, raw-scan dispatch fallback and scoped policy-boundary classification. Project-level `.cve-fix.yaml`, configurable registries and Claude/Codex review are implemented. The hardcoded Submariner builder-image fallback remains specifically for unconfigured Shipyard consumers; it is not used when a project or environment builder override is supplied. Resolve its placement or parameterization for the general contribution against the original no-hardcoded-values criterion.

Six isolated configuration/detection probes pass: strict command types, project and environment precedence, the exact remaining fallback, external registry selection and missing-registry failure. Twenty-six selected existing-source checks pass: policy findings retain their scope, failed repairs and new findings stay actionable, and real offline workspace changes are vendored and built before commit, with incompatible sibling changes rolled back. The temporary harness initially omitted the documented registry shape and the scan fixture’s go.mod; correcting those fixtures produced the passing results. No implementation change was needed. These are bounded probes of pinned source, not a repeat of the PR’s reported full regression/live validation, installed runtime matrix or non-Submariner CVE-agent qualification.

The complete ai-helpers main tree remains `a6271760`; all 35 open PRs and the complete one-result maintainer PR search show no delivery of these two maintained workflows. Three existing CVE-related contracts retain their distinct scopes; similar names do not satisfy these issues’ criteria or establish a contribution conflict. Only the pending CVE-fix payload is shortened to implemented configuration/review support and the specific remaining fallback/merge work. Mutable SHA/check/thread details stay in the dated plan. Both prepared ADF requests validate with exact text, one linked PR each and initial employee visibility. The agent draft, all seven posted comments, applied epic description, other pending blocks and original criteria are preserved. No Jira write, status/field change, new issue, upstream implementation change, cluster operation or release was performed. Group 2 remains next for review and approval; raw exports, pinned source and probes stay outside this checkout.

## Approved contribution comments posted

After explicit approval, the two exact contribution comments were posted in order on October 8: **Contribute generalized CVE agent to openshift/ai-helpers**, comment `18831845` at 11:48:24 UTC, then **Contribute go-fix-cves to openshift/ai-helpers**, comment `18831852` at 11:48:51 UTC. Fresh preflight read seven full issues, all 12 comments and 64 history events, target comment permissions and employee-group membership. Both targets’ criteria, hierarchy, statuses and complete old histories remained unchanged; the approved progress was absent. Agent #35/main, open Shipyard #2582 at `b347a44d` and ai-helpers main remained at the reviewed source identities.

Pre-post validation caught a trailing colon inside the prepared CVE-agent PR href. Schema, visible-text and link-count checks alone had not caught it. The request was rebuilt with the exact PR URL marked as a link and the approved colon retained as plain text; no visible wording changed. The plan now explicitly requires exact href checks and sentence punctuation outside link marks.

Exactly one POST per target returned 201, with employee visibility in each initial request. Exact stored ADF, all rendered paragraphs and each clickable PR URL were verified before continuing. Complete target read-backs verify one prior comment preserved and one new comment each, unchanged five/six changelog events, all other issue fields, parent/subtask membership and watch metadata. Only `comment` and `updated` changed; both issues remain New. No parent comment, field edit, transition, new issue, upstream implementation change, cluster operation or release was performed. Raw preflight, requests, read-backs and receipts remain outside this checkout.

Group 2 is complete; the two payloads are fixed posted records, bringing the total to nine comments plus the already-applied Kubernetes epic description. The next queued approval is the group 4 builder comment. The release candidate remains on hold, Submariner description edits and new stories remain pending, and EVPN stays deferred. All payload code blocks, original criteria and other posted records are unchanged.

## Builder migration comment refreshed October 8

The next queued approval remains one comment on **[Multicluster Networking] Migrate to ART golang builders [by 15th October 2026]**. Fresh reads cover the target, its parent, the ART infrastructure epic and the existing PQC issue: four full documents, all 16 comments and 132 changelog events. The builder target remains New, due October 15, with zero comments. Target/parent/ART descriptions, original criteria, hierarchy, statuses, deadline and complete histories remain unchanged. Browse/Add Comments and employee-group membership are confirmed. The ART epic’s Closed status records infrastructure delivery; it does not complete this squad’s consumer migration. The lifecycle comment and nine fixed posted records remain unchanged.

Fresh source coverage reads 33 branch/ref selections across six repositories, 31 immutable trees and 7,454 non-vendored text files, with a broader builder-reference scan. All 33 heads match the preceding audit. All inventory pins and module floors are verified, including the four added 2.10–2.13 rows. Each of the 18 ticket-listed component Dockerfiles uses UBI Go Toolset, with both push/PR selections confirmed. Addon Brew consumers, module floors, runtime bases and all returned pipeline parameters/PaC filters are inspected. Source copies on 5.1/5.2 and 4.23 filter for main; appstudio 2.14 filters for release-2.14 despite #2792 targeting the appstudio branch. Release-2.10 has no returned Tekton files. These distinctions prevent treating a branch copy or task-ref PR as qualification of the intended build. The 15 open addon PRs and #2792’s two-file scope still show no delivered builder migration; unpublished work is not excluded.

Four parent-documented floating RHEL9 ART tags (Go 1.23–1.26) resolve locally. All sixteen Linux architecture-specific configs are read by immutable child digest; each index has amd64, arm64, ppc64le and s390x. Config GO_VERSION and image version labels agree across each tag’s platforms: 1.23.10, 1.24.13, 1.25.14 and 1.26.7. These are declared metadata, not executed compiler measurements. Local access does not establish CI entitlement or layer/build/crypto behavior. The 1.23 family remains below release-2.10’s 1.24.0 source floor; preserve compiled-module and toolchain contracts when selecting candidates. Cached release-data at 8c18efee is unchanged and supplies source-mapping context, not a current deployment read; Konflux authentication expired in the prior October 8 preflight.

The refreshed inventory is published at `74d1862651e0343d0946811941b65ca8ece7b1aa` before the comment’s immutable link is updated. The draft adds verified registry metadata, replaces outdated tag-availability work with supported-source and CI-access work, and explicitly retains migration and compiler/platform qualification. Its prepared ADF validates against the published schema with exact visible text, the exact pinned inventory href and initial employee visibility; sentence punctuation stays outside link marks. Only this pending payload changes; all nine posted comments, the applied Kubernetes description, other pending blocks and original criteria are preserved. No Jira write, Dockerfile/dependency/pipeline edit, image layer pull, container execution, build submission, deployment or release was performed. Raw issue exports, source scans, registry indexes/configs and validation remain outside this checkout. Two full validation attempts encountered intermittent failures in unchanged release-note review code: exit 141 during interrupted-result recovery, then the previously observed sign-off assertion. The focused target passed all 48 checks. Both paths pipe Git history into an early-exit reader (awk or grep), which can produce SIGPIPE under pipefail; this is a possible cause, not a confirmed reproduction. This audit does not change release scripts or bypass checks.

## Builder migration scope extended October 8

The follow-up tests whether an addon Konflux Dockerfile swap would complete the migration. Coverage adds every published addon release/appstudio branch (25 selections), all non-vendored source text and vendored build inputs: 46 refs across eight repositories, 45 trees, 9,708 owned text files and 442 vendored build files. The 33 preceding refs are refreshed; main advances to 1105c8c1 with only deployment resource limits changed, while both Dockerfiles, modules and Makefile remain byte-identical. All other preceding heads match. Fresh target/parent/ART/PQC reads preserve full fields, all 16 comments and 132 changelog events; the target remains New with no comments and the October 15 deadline.

Pinned OpenShift release configuration at 8dc32b0f selects ordinary Dockerfile image builds for ten addon branch configurations, separate from its Go build roots. The ordinary Brew stage therefore needs its own disposition alongside Konflux; OpenShift CI and remote Konflux registry access need separate qualification. Official CI Operator documentation confirms images.from replaces the last FROM, and input substitutions are separate; these image entries have no explicit input substitutions overriding the Brew stage. Shared stolostron/image-builder at 363bb468 is UBI-based and downloads Go directly, with no named Brew consumer in its source. Its 1.26 Dockerfile specifies 1.26.8, compared with the earlier ART metadata’s 1.26.7: retain a required-patch check, not an assumption of a delivered compiler or a mandated downgrade. The Shipyard Fedora/dnf source and inspected vendored build inputs add no direct Brew consumer.

Both ordinary and Konflux Brew references remain on relevant addon release branches. The 2.15/2.16 Konflux paths explicitly enable CGO and strictfipsruntime, which migration builds must preserve and exercise. Three more appstudio branches retain Brew references; 2.12 advertises Go 1.21 against a 1.22.0 root floor. Release-2.9 also advertises a lower compiler minor than its root floor. These are source discrepancies, not measured failures or automatically supported scope. All older release branches lack a Konflux Dockerfile. No addon RPM lock inputs are found. The eight-component setup wrapper does not include addon, so its copy-forward behavior does not propagate addon fixes.

Cached tenant source at 8c18efee selects release-2.11–2.17, release-5.0 and main for both 5.1/5.2 components; this explains matching main filters and does not establish a defect. A fresh read-only authentication check returns Unauthorized, so current deployed source and credential state remain unverified. The shared ACM catalog at d6b74add forwards Dockerfile, hermetic, prefetch and platform parameters; the exact build task OCI manifest identifies immutable official source cab160f4. Task source is inspected without pulling layers or running it. Mutable catalog main must be recorded as resolved for each qualification run. Registry pull entitlement is distinct from RPM subscription certificates; no new entitlement resource is inferred. The 15 open addon PRs’ 42 changed-file records include no Dockerfile change; pipeline updates do not deliver this migration.

The expanded inventory is published at `86db592bd6b886ee6b9b01cc44a836cfff7b38fa` and the pending draft links to that verified content. The draft now covers both Dockerfiles, both CI contexts, required compiler patch levels and existing crypto/platform contracts. Only that pending payload changes; the nine posted comments, applied Kubernetes description, other pending payloads, original criteria and queue ordering remain fixed. The preceding intermittent sign-off assertion recurred during full validation; the focused review target passed all 48 checks and the unchanged full suite passed on retry. No test was bypassed. No Jira write, upstream implementation edit, image layer pull, container execution, build submission or deployment occurred. Raw source, issue, CI configuration and task-manifest evidence stays outside the checkout.

## Builder migration contracts refined October 8

All 46 previously inspected source refs remain unchanged. Fresh full reads cover the four builder/parent/ART/PQC issues, all 16 comments and 132 changelog events. Target criteria, status, October 15 deadline and histories remain unchanged; the parent's development-panel cache differs only in embedded JSON key order. Browse/Add Comments and employee visibility are confirmed. Fresh Konflux authentication is Unauthorized; deployed source and credential contents remain unverified.

Registry reads cover five ART indexes/twenty platform configs and two current Brew indexes/eight configs, each with amd64, arm64, ppc64le and s390x. Brew Go 1.25 declares RHEL8 and no explicit GOAMD64; ART's Go 1.25 RHEL8 candidate preserves those declarations and the Go RPM build. Its root filesystem metadata differs, so qualification remains required. Selecting RHEL9 would also change the OS/RPM family and declare GOAMD64=v2; the deadline does not require that extra transition. Brew and ART Go 1.26 both declare 1.26.7/v2, with different RPM releases/filesystem metadata. The separate CI builder's 1.26.8 is a difference between paths, not proof of a migration downgrade or a mandated minimum. Explicit addon -mod=mod overrides ART GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor; tools compilation/prefetch is required only by actual consumers. No new vendoring or RPM-entitlement requirement is inferred.

Six pinned main/2.11/2.15 Prow job documents distinguish images checks from CI-root source build/unit checks and pass the image-import pull-secret input. Pinned CI Operator source traces it to the generated Build's dockerStrategy.pullSecret. Official Konflux registry guidance and the exact remote-task source trace service-account credentials through Docker configuration to the remote worker/build container. These are two credential paths to verify against the actual repository and internal entitlement; no missing secret is established. All ten inspected addon CI configurations run integration from test-bin; the main integration target compiles/runs an envtest binary, not the output image. A basic /submariner --version check can exercise the output executable/loader; no-argument exit 1 is intentional. Source/build success, image publication and this basic executable check do not prove controller readiness or crypto behavior. The plan requires separate runtime evidence under existing deployment settings and every required platform.

The inventory is published at `79b842aef48bc1336335002fbf5c98fce8a8c92a` before the pending draft's immutable href is updated. Its prepared ADF validates against the published schema with exact visible text, the exact published href and initial employee restriction. Only that pending payload changes; all nine posted comments, the applied Kubernetes description, other payloads, original criteria and queue order remain fixed. The first inventory commit's full checks pass. The runtime clarification's first full run encounters the previously observed release-note signoff assertion; the focused target passes all 48 checks and the unchanged full suite passes on retry. No check is bypassed. No Jira write, upstream implementation edit, image layer pull, container execution, build submission, deployment or release occurs. Raw evidence and validation logs remain outside the checkout.

## Builder output qualification refined October 8

Fresh reads refresh all 46 source refs: 44 are unchanged; main advances to 6ec4f450 for a SARIF action update and release-2.17 to e27719e3 for removal of deployment resource limits. Complete compare responses show one commit/file per advance; Dockerfiles, modules and build/test sources remain unchanged. The inventory pins are refreshed and runtime checks must use current deployment settings. The four full Jira documents, all 16 comments and 132 changelog events are semantically unchanged; embedded development-panel JSON key order is normalized for comparison. The target remains New with no comments and its October 15 deadline. A fresh Konflux authentication check still returns Unauthorized.

Immutable Go FIPS fork guidance is read on the 1.24, 1.25 and 1.26 branches. The 1.25 guidance confirms OpenSSL is loaded dynamically and strict checks are activated by FIPS mode; startup outside that mode or static library inspection is insufficient qualification. The plan retains existing CGO/strict-FIPS/backend settings and requires actual crypto operations in the supported FIPS deployment context. Official Go documentation confirms toolchain selection can use PATH/downloads and repackaged defaults; compiler version alone does not establish the downstream crypto contract. Addon --version reports application identity. Inspect the exact output binary externally with go version -m and reconcile its settings with the build log, then qualify runtime behavior separately. Pinned ACM common.yaml maps build-platforms into a task matrix and constructs the output index from its IMAGE_REF results: match actual published child digests to platform build/runtime evidence. These are qualification requirements, not evidence that a migration image has been built or exercised.

The inventory is published at `4fe1c05d829f6e25d33eee137c1f1161c94e9999` before the pending draft link is refreshed. Draft text is unchanged; its prepared ADF preserves exact visible text, the exact published href and initial employee restriction. All other payloads, nine posted comments, the applied Kubernetes description, original criteria and queue ordering remain fixed. The inventory commit passes full make test and gitlint without a retry. No Jira write, implementation edit, layer pull, container execution, build submission, deployment or release occurs; raw evidence stays outside the checkout.

## Builder closure checked across all Submariner repositories October 8

The issue requests migration of Brew/OSBS/registry-proxy/pinned-NVR Go-builder consumers in addon, lighthouse, submariner and operator; its explicit ocp/builder exception does not automatically exempt a different stage or builder. Fresh branch pagination and source inspection cover nine repositories: those four, subctl, shipyard, admiral, cloud-prepare and operator FBC. Every returned canonical release branch plus devel/main and all four addon appstudio branches is scanned: 137 refs, 136 distinct trees, 27,547 owned text files, 442 vendored build inputs and 328 Dockerfile paths. Work/bot/reference branches are not automatically active consumers; any selected by live CI/tenant configuration must be resolved before closure. Source existence alone does not establish support.

All 36 ticket-listed component Konflux Dockerfiles on 0.19–0.24 use UBI Go Toolset. No literal Brew Go-builder reference is found outside addon in the nine source repos; package-registry-proxy options are distinguished from Brew image consumers. The libraries have no Dockerfiles; FBC uses prebuilt OPM v1.65.0, nettest has a runtime-only Konflux stage and the bundle uses scratch. Ordinary/shared/older paths retain their own disposition, including externally resolved tasks and image overrides. The newly published 0.25 branches have no Konflux Dockerfiles, and component setup copies them from the predecessor. The tracked release-management CVE workflow still lists Brew tags: its guidance must change alongside addon Dockerfiles to prevent reintroduction. The plan now requires an accepted migration/no-change/retired disposition for every repo and active build source, merged affected changes and passing compiler/pull/build/runtime/platform evidence before closure. It does not require changing unaffected builders or unrelated runtime/index registry references.

Fresh full target/parent/ART/PQC reads preserve all fields semantically, all 16 comments and 132 changelog events, including the target's New status, zero comments and October 15 deadline. Live tenant/credential verification remains blocked by the latest expired-authentication read; no cluster state is inferred from cached sources. The inventory is published at `123ebebaa7279a5d75b7a3d2626988475d0a8ee8` before the pending draft link is updated. Its concise scope/count/guidance wording is revised; prepared ADF validates with exact visible text, the exact published href and initial employee visibility. Other payloads, nine posted comments, the applied Kubernetes description, original criteria and queue ordering remain fixed. The inventory commit passes full make test and gitlint on the first run. No Jira write, release/workflow implementation edit, layer pull, container execution, build submission or deployment occurs. Raw source and Jira exports remain outside this checkout.

## Builder planning comment posted October 8

After the maintainer approved posting, a fresh full target/parent/ART/PQC preflight preserves all criteria, statuses, hierarchy, 16 comments and 132 changelog events; Browse/Add Comments and employee-group membership are confirmed. Pre-post source refresh covers all 137 canonical refs. Addon 5.1/5.2 have advanced to 6ec4f450; the complete compare contains only the already inspected resource-limit removal and SARIF action update. Dockerfiles, modules and build/test inputs are unchanged, so the approved draft's claims and pinned, dated inventory remain valid. The published inventory at 123ebeb is read back byte-for-byte before posting. Prepared ADF, exact visible text, the single immutable href and initial employee visibility validate.

One POST creates ACM-45318 comment `18839276` at **15:37:20 UTC**. Read-back verifies exact ADF, rendered paragraphs, the inventory href and `Red Hat Employee` visibility. The full comment history increments from zero to one, with all previous records and all 132 changelog events preserved. Parent/ART/PQC full fields are semantically unchanged. Target differences are comment, updated, watches and customfield_10024: field metadata identifies the latter as `[CHART] Date of First Response`, now matching the first comment's timestamp; the posting account is now watching and watchCount increases by one. No separate field or watcher operation is performed. All other fields, original criteria, hierarchy and New status are unchanged. No migration/source/CI/runtime completion is claimed.

The comment becomes the tenth fixed posted record, alongside the already-applied Kubernetes description. Group 4 is complete; the held release candidate remains on hold and group 6 Submariner description edits are the next eligible review. All payload code blocks and other criteria remain unchanged; no other Jira write, implementation edit, cluster operation, image execution, build or release occurs. Raw Jira responses and the posting receipt stay outside this checkout.

## Documentation validation

The grouping, final review and second review pass full `make test` and commit lint. Current validation covers full repository checks, 153 relative links/anchors across all 25 Markdown files changed by the PR, all 58 unique queue keys, historical inventory totals, posted text/links/visibility and whitespace. Pending payloads are revised independently of the ten fixed posted comments and the applied Kubernetes epic description; original acceptance criteria and dated evidence limits are retained. Dated Jira/PR/permission evidence still requires target-specific refresh before a write.
No release/test implementation changed. Raw Jira exports remain outside this checkout; local validation logs are untracked.
