# Share Stage FBC with QE

**When:** After FBC stage releases applied (Step 13)

## Process

**TODO:** Document Jira workflow for sharing FBC stage releases with QE.

QE installs via FBC (5 OCP versions: 4-16 through 4-20), which includes component bundles from the stage release (Step 10).

## Done When

QE has FBC stage release information and begins testing.

**Next:** Wait for QE approval before proceeding to Steps 15 and 17 (prod releases).
